# Plant-Disease-Prediction
In this project, a convolutional neural network is developed in order to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease. This is a classification model, which is developed using tensorflow and keras. It can be implemented as a mobile app which will help farmers to easily diagnose crop diseases.
